##  About The Project
Today social media is the most used way to express emotions and share feelings, and WhatsApp is one of the most popular social media platforms. The model emerging from this research study aims to perform a data and sentiment analysis of WhatsApp chats of text messages of the user. The creation of a model that categorizes opinions as either positive, negative, or neutral is crucial. The mining of behavior is another name for sentiment analysis. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information retrieval techniques, sentiment analysis comprises behavior, opinions, and sentiments of the text, chat, or online communication. The model proposed in the project aims to examine the trends of WhatsApp usage in the youths belonging to the age group of 18-25 years and their sentimental behavior. The behavior patterns are eradicated during the project. The only group chats are focused for the proposed model and study. It will make it easier to determine whether the person enjoys using emojis and whether they do so as an adjunct to verbal communication or to express their emotions more fully. The benefit of the model is that it was developed using simple Python modules like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and NLTK which are used to create information frames and plot various types of graphs.
